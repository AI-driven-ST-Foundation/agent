imghandler is the facade and have one responsability : 
recieve image base64 return link or base64 if failed to upload 

whatever the api will be used ( there is a default one , but another ones for backup )


current working which is enough for mvp :

Handles 3 fallback cases with warnings:
✅ No provider configured → returns base64 + warning
✅ Upload fails (returns None) → returns base64 + warning
✅ Exception raised → returns base64 + warning
